Fandom FE challenge using react

### To Run

View the create-react-app [README](https://github.com/basandlin/fandom-react/blob/master/app/README.md) in the `/app` directory

### Considerations

- Clicking on the title logo will navigate you to the home page
- CSS variables were written with vanilla CSS and used in .scss files, per requirements
- A couple of widths were sacrificed in favor of using flexbox to be more dynamic. In the real world, I would have discussed this with a designer.
- In addition, I left out the talent calc background as it just appears to be dark. If it has linear gradient, I'm happy to demonstrate that with CSS.
- As I haven't written React in a good while, my progress was a bit slower than if I had used Vue. I chose to use React because this is the framework the team uses, and I wanted to demonstrate ability to adapt by getting caught up on the latest syntax.

### TO DO

1. "Liquids" Navigation dropdown. Although I didn't quite have time to import a dropdown and implement, this would have been next. Do note, though, that "Liquids" navigates to the sub-path "Flammable"
2. Lines between Talents in Talent Calculator
3. Talent border styling
4. unit tests
